    "# When should you use KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use KNN when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You have labeled examples already**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For example, you know which animals are cats 🐱 and which are dogs 🐶, and now you want to classify a new animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The data isn’t too huge**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * KNN can get slow if you have millions of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You want something simple**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * KNN doesn’t do fancy math behind the scenes. It just looks at who’s closest and votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Your categories are clear**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Works best when the groups (like cats vs dogs) are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When patterns depend on similarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If “things that look alike usually belong to the same group,” KNN is a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want to predict whether a fruit is an **apple 🍎** or an **orange 🍊**.\n",
    "You already know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apples are usually **red** and **smaller**.\n",
    "* Oranges are usually **orange** and **bigger**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you get a new fruit that is **medium-sized and orange-colored**.\n",
    "KNN will check which known fruits it’s most similar to. If most of its nearest neighbors are oranges, it says: *“This is an orange!”*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In short:\n",
    "Use KNN when your problem is about **classifying new things based on their similarity to known things**, and your dataset is not too large."
