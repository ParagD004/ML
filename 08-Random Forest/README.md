# Random Forest - Module 08

A comprehensive guide to Random Forest algorithms, ensemble techniques, and their applications in both classification and regression tasks.

## üìö Contents

### üå≥ Core Concept
Random Forest is an **ensemble of decision trees** that combines multiple models to create more accurate and robust predictions. It uses **bagging** (bootstrap aggregating) to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

## ‚ö° Key Features

### **How Random Forest Works:**
1. Creates random samples from the dataset (with replacement)
2. Builds multiple decision trees on different subsets
3. Combines predictions:
   - **Classification**: Majority vote
   - **Regression**: Average of all predictions

### **Advantages:**
- **Reduces overfitting** compared to single decision trees
- **Handles missing values** and mixed data types
- **Provides feature importance** rankings
- **Works well with default parameters**
- **Robust to outliers**

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used
- **scikit-learn**: RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
