## Advanced Features

### 1. Cross-Validation

```python
# Built-in cross-validation
cv_results = xgb.cv(
    params=params,
    dtrain=dtrain,
    num_boost_round=1000,
    nfold=5,
    stratified=True,
    shuffle=True,
    seed=42,
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
    verbose_eval=True
)
```

```python
# Prevent overfitting with early stopping
model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
    verbose=True
)
```

### 3. Feature Importance

```python
# Multiple importance types
importance_gain = model.feature_importances_  # Default: gain
importance_weight = model.get_booster().get_score(importance_type='weight')
importance_cover = model.get_booster().get_score(importance_type='cover')
```

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [3, 4, 5, 6],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    'subsample': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0],
    'colsample_bytree': [0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=xgb.XGBClassifier(),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring='accuracy',
    cv=5,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Memory Optimization
- Use `tree_method='hist'` for large datasets
- Set `max_bin` to control memory usage
- Use `single_precision_histogram=True` for memory savings

### 2. Speed Optimization
- Use `tree_method='gpu_hist'` for GPU acceleration
- Set `n_jobs=-1` for parallel processing
- Use early stopping to reduce training time

### 3. Accuracy Optimization
- Tune `learning_rate` and `n_estimators` together
- Experiment with `max_depth` and regularization
- Use cross-validation for robust evaluation



## Advantages

✅ **Superior Performance**: Often wins ML competitions
✅ **Speed**: Highly optimized implementation
✅ **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently
✅ **Flexibility**: Many parameters and objectives
✅ **Robustness**: Built-in regularization and cross-validation

❌ **Installation**: Additional dependency (not in sklearn)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Defaults**: Begin with default parameters, then tune systematically
2. **Cross-Validation**: Always use CV for hyperparameter selection
3. **Early Stopping**: Monitor validation metrics to prevent overfitting
4. **Feature Engineering**: Good features are still crucial for performance
5. **Regularization**: Use L1/L2 regularization for better generalization
6. **Learning Rate**: Lower learning rates often work better with more estimators
7. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle categorical variables appropriately
